        | Hello, as you can tell from the heading, my name is Joel Murphy. I, most recently, graduated from Interactive Media Design - Web at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario in October of 2019. I am a programmer first and a designer second. My developing experience is, in part, thanks to previously graduating from the Computer Programmer program at Georgian College in 2013.
